# Viuteca

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is it?

Viuteca is developed by 3 students at Tec de Monterrey to gather, organize and make available the student Groups' and Societies' virtual event recordings so that the general audience doesn't miss out on anything. You can find recorded workshops, webinars, sessions and much more, all presented by the diverse student groups from the university.

### Why Viuteca?
Social distancing in an increasingly digital world has greatly increased the number of online events and activities' recordings by student groups. 

The main benefit is that video content can be shared and revisited as many times as we like.

The challenge, however, is to be able to find all of these recordings in a single, structured and easy-to-browse location. 
Student Groups' community management teams often use many different platforms and in general do not have a standardized way of publishing/sharing their videos. This can make their video content hard to find and manage, both for the internal staff and for their public, resulting in less visibility and the loss of valuable content.

The solution is to have a single platform that can aggregate all of these videos, regardless of their platform of origin, with a friendly UI to find exactly what you're looking for.

## If you are a visitor to the site
- You can find the latest activities and events uploaded by the students from Tec de Monterrey in the main page and view them in an embedded video player or opening them in their original host platform.
- You can search for specific recordings by title or by name of the student society or group.
- If you like what you see, you give an applause!
- You can freely share the videos with other students, family and friends.

## If you are part of a Student Group or Association
- You can register for an account so that you can share your videos on the site
- All you need to upload a video is the URI pointing to the video file (e.g. Drive, Vimeo, Youtube, etc.) The video URL must have public visibility on the web.
- You can get a notion of how popular your videos are thanks to the applause count!
- You can also provide a description, duration in minutes and seconds, and a thumbnail to your videos.
- All of your recorded events in a single place!
